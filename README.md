# Slice2Volume_Codebase
# Slice2Volume_Data This repository hosts all code that was used to process image data in the Slice2Volume [data repository](https://rodare.hzdr.de/record/801). The Slice2Volume functionality that was used to register histological slices to 3D volumes is maintained in a [separate repository](https://github.com/jo-mueller/Slice2Volume).
