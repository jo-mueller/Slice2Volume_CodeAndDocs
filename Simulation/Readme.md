### Monte-Carlo Simulation

This directory holds all necessary data to reproduce dose-simulations based on the CBCT data provided in the Slice2Volume repository on [RODARE](https://rodare.hzdr.de/deposit/810). 

The simulations can be conducted with the TOOPAS software with the SpaceFiles under MonteCarlo_InputFiles. The output can be padded to the dimensions of the CBCT data with the script zeropadding.py.
